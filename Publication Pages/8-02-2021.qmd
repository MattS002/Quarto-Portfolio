## Abstract

**Introduction.** Although greater workforce diversity brings potential benefits, such as the availability of varied perspectives, it can also lead to greater conflict, undermining employee relationships, and thus effective problem-solving. Indeed, organizations have invested a great deal of time and money in various diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives to maximize the benefits and minimize the costs of a diverse workforce. Surprisingly, however, these initiatives frequently fail to include effective conflict management strategies.

Here we review the current status of organizational conflict literature, conflict management strategies, and their role (or lack thereof) in diversity initiatives. We conclude by providing evidence-based recommendations for the integration of effective conflict management strategies in diversity initiatives and training.
