Specifically, I am interested in understanding if the positive training effects found when comparing pre and post-test scores *depends*, in part, on the employee group assessed. In the data set for this project, there is a variable called \"Mod1\" which is a categorical variable denoting the employee group that is providing the data for each effect.

I did this step [here](/Portfolio pages/MLMAEffect.qmd) and would have to be conducted prior to adding any moderating variables to the meta models. Also note that these values correspond to pre vs. post standardized mean differences; if I wanted to add a moderator to a MLMA model that compares the effect sizes for pre and follow-up time points, I would have to calculate the yi, vi, and Hedges *g* for this comparison prior to any moderation analyses.\n\n::: text-center\n# *MLMA Moderation Analysis*\n:::\n\nI will now add in the moderating variable, Employee_Group, to the MLMA model that compares scores between the pre and post time points.
