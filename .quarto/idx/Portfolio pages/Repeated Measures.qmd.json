W refers to the Machly's W statistic, a non-significant p value indicates that sphericity assumption is met. GGe is the greenhouse-geisser epsilon value and HFe is the Huynh-Feldt epsilon value (use these tests if the spherictiy assumption isn't met). If you want the correct df for either epsilon value, look at the output from the \"anova_test\" function.\n\nNote that sphericity output is only provided when you have at least 3 factors for an IV (the results are the same for 2 levels of a factor so no output is provided).\n\n::: text-center\n## **Post Hoc Tests**\n:::\n\n```{r}\n# Post Hoc Testing\nlibrary(emmeans)\n\nCell_Means <- emmeans(Model, ~ order)\nCell_Means\n\npwc <- DataLong %>%\npairwise_t_test(score ~ order, paired = TRUE,p.adjust.method = \"bonferroni\")\n\npwc\n```\n\n::: text-center\n# **Solution**\n:::\n\nUsing the pairwise t test code above, I can compare levels of the factor to each other just like in previous weeks. For example, t-test results indicate that the oldest siblings had marginally larger SAT scores (M = 59.8) than the youngest siblings (M = 55.5) within each family t(9) = 2.76, p = .07. Again, none of these results meet traditional p-value cutoff scores, so we would conclude that SAT scores did not depend on birth order.\n\nIn this data, children were ordered by birth and grouped within family and SAT values were compared between children. However, all data were collected at one time point. How might this data be analyzed if each child had multiple SAT scores?
