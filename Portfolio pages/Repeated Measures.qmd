# **Project Goal**
:::

The overarching goal of this project is to teach readers how to run a repeated measures ANOVA in R. I will walk through the code below but readers should be familiar with R code prior to working through this code.

This data contains SAT scores for six families, with each family consisting of an older, middle, and younger child. Higher values indicate better SAT scores. I am interested in assessing if birth order in a family with three children effects the child's SAT score.

First I will need to read in the data and a few packages. I only do a bit of cleaning at this stage (i.e., reformatting the dataframe) so prior data cleaning should have already been completed.

```{r, echo=-7}
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(ez)
library(tidyr)
library(tidyverse)

Data <- read_excel("C:/Users/matts/OneDrive/Desktop/002 Matt Desktop/WebsiteData/Data/Repeated Measures Data.xlsx")
head(Data)
```

# **Converting Data Format**
:::

If you look at the data file, you will notice that participants are listed column wise and not row wise since the same family has multiple evaluation points (i.e., three children in a family). I need to flip this so that the data is in long form.

```{r}
#Need to convert data set to long format - it is currently in wide format

DataLong <- Data %>%
gather(key = "order", value = "score", young, middle, oldest) 
#I called these new variables order and score (you can name them what you like so long as it makes sense). 

#Here you want to gather by the grouping factor and make sure the values by group are contained in a new variable, row-wise

DataLong$family <- as.factor(DataLong$family)
DataLong$order <- as.factor(DataLong$order)
DataLong
```

Check how the long version of this data set and the original data set compare. This should help signal how I converted the data to long form and why I had to do so. Next, I want to check that the design is balanced. Unbalanced designs typically violate important assumptions of equal variance (among other issues) so great caution should be taken when conducting unbalanced repeated measures ANOVA.

```{r}
DataLong %>%
group_by(order) %>%
summarise(n = n(), sd = sd(score), var = var(score))
```

# **Repeated Measures ANOVA**
:::

Each cell has the same n size so this design is balanced. Now I am going to run this repeated measures ANOVA three different ways to get different information and so that subsequent functions have the correct object to run. Let's assess if birth order in a family with three children effects the child's SAT score.

```{r}
Repeated <- ezANOVA(DataLong, dv = score, wid = family, within = order, detailed = TRUE, return_aov = TRUE)

Repeated

Model <- aov(score ~ order + Error(family/order), DataLong) 
#Because order is crossed with the random factor family (i.e., each order exists in a particular family), you must specify the error term for order, which in this case is family by order. Do this by adding the term Error(family/order) to the factor order, as shown above.

summary(Model)

library(rstatix)
SphereCorr <- anova_test(DataLong, dv = score, wid = family, within = order)
SphereCorr
```

Results indicate that there is no order effect here on SAT scores, F(2, 18) = 3.17, p = .066 (effect is marginal so we will interpret it for the sake of this example).

Some notes on the output: GES refers to the generalized eta square value. W refers to the Machly's W statistic, a non-significant p value indicates that sphericity assumption is met. GGe is the greenhouse-geisser epsilon value and HFe is the Huynh-Feldt epsilon value (use these tests if the spherictiy assumption isn't met). If you want the correct df for either epsilon value, look at the output from the "anova_test" function.

Note that sphericity output is only provided when you have at least 3 factors for an IV (the results are the same for 2 levels of a factor so no output is provided).

## **Post Hoc Tests**
:::

```{r}
# Post Hoc Testing
library(emmeans)

Cell_Means <- emmeans(Model, ~ order)
Cell_Means

pwc <- DataLong %>%
pairwise_t_test(score ~ order, paired = TRUE,p.adjust.method = "bonferroni")

pwc
```

# **Solution**
:::

Using the pairwise t test code above, I can compare levels of the factor to each other just like in previous weeks. For example, t-test results indicate that the oldest siblings had marginally larger SAT scores (M = 59.8) than the youngest siblings (M = 55.5) within each family t(9) = 2.76, p = .07. Again, none of these results meet traditional p-value cutoff scores, so we would conclude that SAT scores did not depend on birth order.

In this data, children were ordered by birth and grouped within family and SAT values were compared between children. However, all data were collected at one time point. How might this data be analyzed if each child had multiple SAT scores? I cover how to conduct a between and within repeated measures ANOVA in another project already posted in my portfolio tab so feel free to check it out if you are curious!
