I'm an IO psychologist who has spent the past 7 years gaining knowledge and expertise in the areas of organizational effectiveness, data analysis, DEI, and statistical methodology. My current stream of research centers on organizational conflict management, addressing systems of racial disparity in higher education, and promoting employee authenticity.\
\
My goal with this website is to showcase my current skill set and provide a platform for others interested in IOÂ psychology and data analytics to hopefully learn something about the field.

I have worked in both industry and academia and have learned a lot over these years! I've had the pleasure of teaching and supporting graduate level analysis of variance (ANOVA) at the University of Nebraska Omaha using both SAS and R for the past three years. While COVID certainly added barriers to the teaching process, it gave me a great opportunity to learn and teach data analysis in R at the graduate level (hence the Zoom screenshot).

Concurrently, I've helped organizations recognize, analyze, and address common issues such as turnover, training effectiveness, and job performance. I have also helped organizations survey and assess the DEI climate of their workforce, worked with selection procedures to determine adverse impact, built statistical models to predict turnover likelihood, worked on developing psychometrically sound assessments, and served as lead on qualitative and quantitative data collection efforts. Additionally, I have served as a guest editor for the Journal of Social Issues and as editor for research conferences and academic awards.

In my spare time I love jamming out with my cello!

# **Dissertation**
:::

I spent a lot of time working on my dissertation and I would love to share what I found with anyone interested! For my dissertation, I studied how organizational psychological safety (which I experimentally manipulated) influenced perceptions of authenticity at work as well as feelings of well-being and belongingness for both heterosexual and LGBTQ employees. My dissertation was also mixed-methods, so I got to assess the qualitative nuance behind participant's perceptions of psychologically safe and unsafe work experiences!

My dissertation is hosted on [ProQuest](https://www-proquest-com.leo.lib.unomaha.edu/pqdtglobal/docview/2770014140/15D974BD6DE64609PQ/1?accountid=14692). I am currently reworking it for publication so be on the lookout for that article!
